# Angry Birds Level Gen team of Serpentine

Welcome to the code repository of the [Serpentine](https://serpentineai.nl/) team that competed in the [5th Angry Birds Level Gen Competition](http://aibirds.org/level-generation-competition.html) in 2020.
The team consisted of: Wolf van der Hert, Bram Grooten, Thomas Molier, Jelle van Kerkvoorde and Tunahan Sari.

The final bot we submitted is called *Amaru*, which refers to the mythical bird.
You can find its code in the main folder: `Amaru-Generator.py`.
Running the code can take up to half a minute. It will create xml files which represent 'levels', which the Science Birds (Custom Angry Birds game provided in the competition) is able to read. This will only be levels 04-23.

In the 'parameters.txt', test inputs are given that will challenge the generator to use restrictions.

Any details can be found on the competition page.
